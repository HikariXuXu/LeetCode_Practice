## 题目描述
You are visiting a farm that has a single row of fruit trees arranged from left to right. The trees are represented by an integer array `fruits` where `fruits[i]` is the **type** of fruit the `ith` tree produces.

You want to collect as much fruit as possible. However, the owner has some strict rules that you must follow:

- You only have **two** baskets, and each basket can only hold a **single type** of fruit. There is no limit on the amount of fruit each basket can hold.
- Starting from any tree of your choice, you must pick **exactly one fruit** from **every** tree (including the start tree) while moving to the right. The picked fruits must fit in one of your baskets.
- Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must stop.

Given the integer array `fruits`, return the **maximum** number of fruits you can pick.

## Example 1:

    Input: fruits = [1,2,1]
    Output: 3
    Explanation: We can pick from all 3 trees.

## Example 2:

    Input: fruits = [0,1,2,2]
    Output: 3
    Explanation: We can pick from trees [1,2,2].
    If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [0,1].

## Example 3:

    Input: fruits = [1,2,3,2,2]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: We can pick from trees [2,3,2,2].
    If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [1,2].

```python
class Solution:
    def totalFruit(self, fruits: List[int]) -> int:
        maxLength = 0
        i = 0
        pointer = 0
        fruitsSet = set()
        for j in range(len(fruits)):
            if fruits[j] not in fruitsSet:
                fruitsSet.add(fruits[j])
            if len(fruitsSet) > 2:
                i = pointer
                fruitsSet.remove(fruits[i-1])
            if j > 0 and fruits[j] != fruits[j-1]:
                pointer = j
            if maxLength < j - i + 1:
                maxLength = j - i + 1
        return maxLength
```
