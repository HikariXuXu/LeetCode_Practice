## 题目描述
Given two strings `s` and `p`, return *an array of all the start indices of `p`'s anagrams in `s`*. You may return the answer in **any order**.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## Example 1:

    Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
    Output: [0,6]
    Explanation:
    The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
    The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".

## Example 2:

    Input: s = "abab", p = "ab"
    Output: [0,1,2]
    Explanation:
    The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
    The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
    The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".

## 做法
```python
class Solution:
    def findAnagrams(self, s: str, p: str) -> List[int]:
        goal = [0] * 26
        for i in p:
            goal[ord(i) - ord('a')] += 1
        result = []
        record = [0] * 26
        if len(p) > len(s):
            return []
        else:
            for i in range(len(p)):
                record[ord(s[i]) - ord('a')] += 1
            if record == goal:
                result.append(0)
            for i in range(len(s) - len(p)):
                record[ord(s[i]) - ord('a')] -= 1
                record[ord(s[i + len(p)]) - ord('a')] += 1
                if record == goal:
                    result.append(i + 1)
        return result
```
